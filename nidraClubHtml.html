          Total Sleep Time (TST) refers to the actual duration a person spends asleep, excluding wakefulness during
          the night, and is a critical factor in overall sleep quality and health [1]. Higher TST indicates better sleep
          efficiency, which is essential for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and reducing the risk of chronic
          conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes [2].</p>
         <p></p> Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time spent asleep relative to the total time spent in bed, with higher
          values indicating more consolidated and restorative sleep [1]. Poor sleep efficiency, often linked to insomnia
          and sleep disorders.

  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p id="remarksText">
    Understanding sleep stages is essential for assessing overall sleep quality and health [3-4]. Each stage
    plays a unique role in the restorative process:</p>
  <p>• Awake: Normal wakefulness during the night is expected; however, these periods should remain minimal
  to ensure restorative sleep.</p>
  <p>• REM Sleep: REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is critical for dreaming and memory consolidation. The
  brain’s activity during this phase resembles that of wakefulness, which helps with learning and emotional
  regulation.</p> 
  <p>
    • N1 (Light Sleep): This stage represents the transition from wakefulness to sleep, helping the body to relax
    initially.
  </p>
  <p>
    • N2 (Intermediate Sleep): In this phase, the body relaxes more deeply. Heart rate slows, body temperature
    drops, and it becomes more challenging to awaken—factors that contribute to maintaining sleep continuity.
  </p>
  <p>• N3 (Deep Sleep / Slow-Wave Sleep): As the most restorative stage, deep sleep is vital for physical
  recovery, growth, and immune function. During N3, the body repairs tissues, builds bone and muscle, and
  strengthens the immune system, ensuring you wake up feeling refreshed and energetic.

        Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) while at rest. A normal RHR for
        adults is 60–100 bpm, though athletes often have values below 60 bpm due to improved cardiac efficiency
        [3].</p>
       <p> Tachycardia (>100 bpm)
        An RHR above 100 bpm may indicate dehydration, fever, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, anemia, or cardiac
        arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) [4]. In COPD patients, persistent
        tachycardia can signal an exacerbation.</p>
        <p>Bradycardia ('<'60 bpm) An RHR below 60 bpm can be linked to sick sinus syndrome (SSS), heart block (HB), atrioventricular
          nodal block (AVNB), or medication effects (e.g., beta-blockers) [5]. Severe cases may indicate shock states or CNS
          depression.

        Resting Breathing Rate (RBR) refers to the number of breaths per minute (brpm) while at rest, without
        physical exertion or stress. A normal RBR for adults ranges from 12 to 20 brpm, though factors such as
        age, sex, weight, and overall health can influence respiratory rates [6].</p>
        <p>Tachypnea (>20 brpm)
        An RBR above 20 brpm (tachypnea) may indicate acute illness, cardiovascular or pulmonary disorders,
        fever, anxiety, or metabolic acidosis (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) [7]. In COPD patients, tachypnea,
        especially when accompanied by shortness of breath, can signal an exacerbation requiring medical
        attention [8].</p>
       <p>Bradypnea (<"12 brpm) An RBR below 12 brpm (bradypnea) can be associated with neurological impairment, metabolic
          disorders, respiratory depression from opioids or sedatives, sleep apnea, or underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease
          [7]. In COPD patients, severe bradypnea may indicate declining lung function and a high risk of respiratory failure
          [8]. </p>

        and are commonly used in clinical practice [12]:</p>
        <p>0-5: These values do not indicate sleep apnea. Without symptoms, no sleep therapy is needed.</p>
        <p>5-15: These values could indicate mild sleep apnea. Without symptoms no therapy may be needed.
        It is recommended to consult a doctor, especially if there are associated symptoms.</p>
        <p>15-30: These values could indicate moderate sleep apnea. It is recommended to consult a doctor.
        Therapy may be recommended, especially if there are associated symptoms.</p>
